# TESI-Starter-Guide
Manual regarding TESI Toolkit onboarding, and Max 9 patches designed for the TESI toolkit. Max 9 patches include both beginner tips for Max 9, examples of how the TESI Toolkit can be mapped, and a basic patch to get you up and running immediately. 

This builds off work conducted by Fracesco Di Maggio - https://www.francescodimaggio.nl/. More information about all the libraries required to install are included within the manual (Oocsi-Max will be uploaded at a later date, but is not required for this patch).
